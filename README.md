### Introduction

Welcome to the project repo for *Learning Data Visualization with D3.js*, second edition. We're going
to build up this repo over the course of the book, and the "master" branch represents where you
do most of your experimenting and whathaveyou. Each chapter has its own branch, and this README
document is different in each.

In the book, I say merely to clone this repository and do everything in your local fork. Another
way to do this is to first fork this repo (you need to be logged in to GitHub), and then clone your 
personal GitHub fork instead of aendrew/learning-d3. This way, you can do everything from push your 
work to the cloud (where people can look at it while giving you support) to suggesting changes for 
the next edition of the book.

If you want to collaborate with me on this repo, please read the following rules:

1. Use the code conventions specified in eslintrc:recommended, and stick to single quotes unless
    using string interpolation.

2. Squash your commits, and PR against the branch relevant to your changes.

Thanks!

-Ændrew Rininsland, @aendrew
